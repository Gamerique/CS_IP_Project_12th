# CS_IP_Project_12th

PYTHON PROGRAM FOR LINKING CSV FILE AND PYTHON PANDAS

Here I explain the codes/programs I used in that Project-
- I made the program for Mobile Shop Sales Analysis System.
- Through this program, you see the whole shop data in various forms. 
Like in Table form, Line chart, Bar chart, Scatter chart, Pie chart.
- You can also add a new row of data through this.


IMPORTANT NOTICE TO RUN THIS:-
- I provide you two files which is compulsory for running this.
- First is the main Program File and second one is a CSV File which contains the data.
- You need both and one more thing to do is, you have to change the file location from the coding,
Like where you save that CSV File that location will be replaced by the location written in program ('E:\\Rishi Study\\Projects\\IP\\mobile.csv')

THAT'S ALL!!
